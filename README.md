# SAFARI

This is the code for TKDE submission: Patient Health Representation Learning via Correlational Sparse Prior of Medical Features.
Currently, we provide the code of experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset for reference.
However, due to the copyright policies of the MIMIC-III dataset, we only present the code without source data here.

- The code is in the jupyter notebook: SAFARI_submission_MIMIC.ipynb.
- The directory './utils/' contains the codes for data preprocessing and performance metrics.
- The directory './model/' saves the trained model checkpoint.
