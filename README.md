Currently, we provide the code of experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset for reference.
However, due to the copyright policies of the MIMIC-III dataset, we only present the code without source data here.

- The main code is in the jupyter notebook: SAFARI_submission_MIMIC.ipynb.
- The directory './utils/' contains the codes for data preprocessing and performance metrics.
- The directory './model/' saves the trained model checkpoint.
